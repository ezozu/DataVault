# DataVault: Secure and Efficient Data Management Solution

DataVault is a robust and performant data management solution written in Go, designed to provide a secure and efficient way to store, retrieve, and manage sensitive data. It prioritizes data integrity and confidentiality through advanced encryption techniques and a flexible architecture. This solution is ideal for applications requiring secure storage of credentials, API keys, personal information, or any other data that needs to be protected from unauthorized access.

This project aims to address the increasing need for secure data handling in modern software applications. DataVault leverages the inherent security features of the Go language, combined with industry-standard encryption algorithms, to provide a robust defense against data breaches. It's designed to be easily integrated into existing Go projects or used as a standalone service, offering a versatile solution for various data management needs. DataVault's focus on efficiency ensures that data operations are performed quickly and reliably, minimizing the impact on application performance.

DataVault offers a comprehensive suite of features, including data encryption at rest and in transit, role-based access control, and audit logging. The architecture is modular, allowing for easy extension and customization to meet specific application requirements. By providing a secure and efficient data management solution, DataVault empowers developers to build more secure and reliable applications, reducing the risk of data breaches and protecting sensitive information.

Key Features:

*   **AES-256 Encryption:** DataVault employs Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with a 256-bit key length to encrypt all stored data. This ensures a high level of security, making it extremely difficult for unauthorized parties to decrypt the data. The encryption key is generated using a cryptographically secure random number generator.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** DataVault implements RBAC to control access to sensitive data. Users are assigned roles with specific permissions, allowing for granular control over who can access and modify data. This ensures that only authorized personnel can access sensitive information. The RBAC system is configurable through a JSON-based policy file.
*   **Audit Logging:** All data access and modification operations are logged to an audit log. This provides a detailed record of all activity, allowing for easy tracking of data usage and identification of potential security breaches. The audit log includes timestamps, user IDs, and the specific data accessed or modified. The audit logs can be configured to be stored in a file or sent to a central logging server.
*   **Data Versioning:** DataVault supports data versioning, allowing users to track changes to data over time. Each time data is modified, a new version is created, and the old version is preserved. This allows users to revert to previous versions of data if necessary and provides a historical record of data changes. Versions are automatically purged based on a configurable retention policy.
*   **Pluggable Storage Backends:** DataVault is designed with pluggable storage backends, allowing users to choose the storage mechanism that best suits their needs. Currently, it supports file-based storage and integration with relational databases via the `database/sql` package. This allows for flexibility and scalability in data storage.
*   **Secure API:** The DataVault API is secured using TLS/SSL encryption. This ensures that all communication between clients and the DataVault server is encrypted, protecting sensitive data from interception. The API also supports authentication and authorization, further enhancing security. The API is accessible via HTTP/2.
*   **CLI Tool:** A command-line interface (CLI) tool is provided for easy interaction with DataVault. The CLI tool allows users to perform various operations, such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting data, as well as managing users and roles. The CLI tool is designed to be user-friendly and provides comprehensive help documentation.

Technology Stack:

*   **Go:** The core programming language used for building DataVault. Go's concurrency features and security focus make it an ideal choice for this project.
*   **AES-256:** Advanced Encryption Standard with 256-bit key for data encryption. Provides strong encryption for sensitive data.
*   **bcrypt:** Used for securely hashing passwords. bcrypt is a widely used and well-regarded password hashing algorithm.
*   **`database/sql`:** Go's standard library package for interacting with relational databases. Allows DataVault to support multiple database backends.
*   **JSON:** Used for configuration files and API data serialization. JSON is a lightweight and human-readable data format.

Installation:

1.  Ensure you have Go installed and configured on your system. Verify this by running `go version`.
2.  Clone the DataVault repository from GitHub:
    `git clone https://github.com/ezozu/DataVault.git`
3.  Navigate to the DataVault directory:
    `cd DataVault`
4.  Build the DataVault application:
    `go build -o datavault`
5.  (Optional) Install the DataVault binary to your system's PATH:
    `sudo mv datavault /usr/local/bin`

Configuration:

DataVault requires a configuration file to specify settings such as the storage backend, encryption key, and listening address. The configuration file should be in JSON format. Here's an example configuration file:

{
    "storage_backend": "file",
    "file_path": "/path/to/data.db",
    "encryption_key": "YOUR_ENCRYPTION_KEY",
    "listen_address": ":8080",
    "audit_log_path": "/path/to/audit.log"
}

*   `storage_backend`: Specifies the storage backend to use. Options: "file" (default), "postgres", "mysql".
*   `file_path`: The path to the data file when using the file-based storage backend.
*   `encryption_key`: The encryption key to use. It is strongly recommended to generate a cryptographically secure random key and store it securely.
*   `listen_address`: The address to listen on for incoming requests.
*   `audit_log_path`: The path to the audit log file.

The `encryption_key` can also be set via the environment variable `DATA_VAULT_ENCRYPTION_KEY`. Environment variables take precedence over configuration file values.

Usage:

To start the DataVault server, run the following command:

`./datavault --config config.json`

Replace `config.json` with the path to your configuration file.

DataVault provides a REST API for interacting with the data store. Here are some example API endpoints:

*   **POST /data/{key}:** Create or update data with the given key. Request body should contain the data to be stored. Requires authentication with appropriate write permissions. Example:
    `curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"value": "my secret data"}' http://localhost:8080/data/my_key`

*   **GET /data/{key}:** Retrieve data with the given key. Requires authentication with appropriate read permissions. Example:
    `curl http://localhost:8080/data/my_key`

*   **DELETE /data/{key}:** Delete data with the given key. Requires authentication with appropriate delete permissions. Example:
    `curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/data/my_key`
